    This is a microgrid modelling code, which can be used to assess the economic and environmental impacts of
    integrating renewable energy and energy storage assets into an otherwise isolated microgrid (presumably
    reliant on diesel, or other fuel-based, generation to begin with).


    The makefile and all source code was successfully tested on the following OS and architectures:

        Operating System: Linux Mint 20.2
                  Kernel: Linux 5.4.0-162-generic
            Architecture: x86-64

        Operating System: Windows 11 Home
                 Version: 10.0.22621 Build 22621
            Architecture: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor


    The following compilers were used in testing:

        g++ (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2) 9.4.0
        g++ (Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0


    PGMcpp has the following dependencies (by compiler link):

        -lpthread


    In the directory for this project, you should find this README, a license file, a makefile, and the
following sub-directories:

    /data           (to hold model input and output data)
    /docs           (to hold various documentation, including the user manual [which you should read!])
    /header         (to hold header files)
    /projects       (to hold project models)
    /source         (to hold source files)
    /third_party    (to hold third party content used in the development of PGMcpp)
