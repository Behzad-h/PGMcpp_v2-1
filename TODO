- test CYCLE_CHARGING_IN_ORDER control implementation
- implement LOAD_FOLLOWING_SMART_COMBUSTION control
- implement Dispatchable <-- Hydro asset
- implement Sean's battery degradation model
- implement some kind of foresight, or receding horizon, control (will need linear programming functionality for this)
- Python wrapper with per timestep callback functionality (so Python objects can work with PGMcpp objects)

- ONGOING: update docs!
