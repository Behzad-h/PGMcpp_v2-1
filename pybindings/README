    // ======== METHOD 1: build Python 3 bindings using make ======== //

    NOTE THAT THIS METHOD DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS. FOR WINDOWS, ONE MUST USE
    METHOD 2.

    To compile Python 3 bindings for PGMcpp, first run

        $   make all

    from the PGMcpp root directory. Once this step completes sucessfully, you should
    see ALL TESTS PASSED.


    Next, ensure that you have pybind11 installed. To do so, you can just

        $   pip install pybind11

    Once that is done, simply run

        $   make pybindings

    from the PGMcpp root directory. This will compile the Python 3 bindings for PGMcpp
    (which is then written to pybindings/PGMcpp.<extension-suffix>), and then run the
    test script at pybindings/test_bindings_from_make.py. If all tests pass, then you
    are set up and ready to go. You should only need to do this step once!


    At this point, you should just be able to

        import PGMcpp

    in any of your Python scripts.
